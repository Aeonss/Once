I believe you forgot my birthday present last year, so now I'm returning the favor. Happy Birthday!
It's your birthday? Let's get up to some mischief!
A wise man once said, "Forget about your past - you cannot change it." I'd like to add: "Forget about your present - I didn't get you one."
You're how old?! Better take that cake outdoors to light the candles! Have a very happy birthday.
It's OK to light the candles on your birthday cake now; I've already alerted the fire department.
You know, they say that age is all in your mind. The key is to prevent it from trickling down into your body.
Congratulations on being born a really long time ago.
You might be prehistoric, but at least you're not extinct!
Congratulations, you've finally reached the wonder years... wonder where your car is parked? Wonder where you left your phone? Wonder where your glasses are? Wonder what day it is?
Life is short. Smile while you still have teeth.
You're not old! ...oh, no, wait, actually you are, sorry about that...
Don't stress about your eyesight failing as you get older. It's nature's way of protecting you from shock as you walk past the mirror.
Happy Birthday!! You only look as old as the last selfie you took.
I wouldn't say you're old... you've just been young for longer than most of us.
Don't grow up... It's a trap!
Great news! ...you're still alive!
You've got more than half a century of accumulated knowledge and wisdom! That would be awesome... if you could remember any of it.
You know, I would be a whole lot more excited about you turning one year older if I was in your will. Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday to someone who has attended more birthday parties for kids than adults this year.
I thought you might need some help with the candles. Happy Birthday!
